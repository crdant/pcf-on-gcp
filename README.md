### PCF - GCP Automation Scripts

## Inputs

Add a file named personal.sh to include your Google account, Google project, and domain:

```
ACCOUNT="your-account@your-domain-or-gmail.com"
PROJECT="your-project"
DOMAIN="domain-for-your-pcf-install"
```

You can add other variables there to override the variables in lib/env.sh. Some of those will move into commandline arguments soon,
but you can customize them otherwise using personal.sh today.
